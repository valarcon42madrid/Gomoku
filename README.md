       NOTES:

It's a modified version of Gomoku (A game based on make an alignement of 5 to win) to make more complex to the AI. Here you could capture 2 pieces of the enemy by making a sandwich with your's. It's forbidden to make a "cross of 3 and 3" without block spaces (what assure you the win) and there is an alternative way of victory in case of 5 captures from the same player.
